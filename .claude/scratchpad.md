## Task 19 Planning: Image Optimization and Lazy Loading

### Background Analysis
**Current State:** Task 18 completed the portfolio gallery with basic image loading using the native `loading="lazy"` attribute. However, the current implementation lacks:
- Server-side image optimization and resizing
- WebP/AVIF format conversion for modern browsers
- Progressive loading with blur effects
- Responsive image serving based on device capabilities
- Efficient image storage and CDN integration

### Key Challenges Identified

**1. Backend Image Processing**
- Need image optimization pipeline for uploaded images
- Multiple size variants generation (thumbnails, medium, large)
- Format conversion (JPEG/PNG → WebP/AVIF) with fallbacks
- Storage optimization for the Unraid environment

**2. Frontend Lazy Loading Enhancement**
- Replace basic `loading="lazy"` with advanced intersection observer
- Progressive image loading with blur-to-sharp transitions
- Skeleton loaders while images are loading
- Error handling and fallback images

**3. Performance Considerations**
- Reduce initial page load times
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS)
- Efficient memory usage in gallery views
- Mobile performance optimization

**4. Storage and Delivery**
- Organize optimized images in public storage
- Consider future CDN integration path
- Backup and synchronization with image variants

### Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1: Backend Image Optimization**
1. **Laravel Image Processing Package**
   - Integrate Intervention Image or Spatie Laravel Media Library
   - Create image transformation pipelines
   - Generate multiple sizes on upload

2. **Storage Structure**
   - Organize images by project with size variants
   - Implement clean file naming conventions
   - Create efficient directory structure

3. **API Enhancements**
   - Add image metadata to API responses
   - Include responsive image URLs for different sizes
   - Optimize image delivery endpoints

**Phase 2: Frontend Lazy Loading**
1. **Vue Composable**
   - Create reusable image lazy loading composable
   - Implement intersection observer for viewport detection
   - Add progressive loading states

2. **Enhanced Components**
   - Update ProjectCard with progressive image loading
   - Add skeleton loaders and blur effects
   - Implement error handling and fallbacks

3. **Gallery Optimizations**
   - Optimize Galleria component for large image sets
   - Implement virtual scrolling for performance
   - Add preloading for adjacent images

**Phase 3: Performance & UX**
1. **Loading States**
   - Professional skeleton components
   - Smooth fade-in animations
   - Loading progress indicators

2. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful fallback for failed image loads
   - Retry mechanisms for network issues
   - Alternative content for missing images

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Reduce image file sizes by 60-80% through optimization
- ✅ Improve portfolio page load time by 40%+
- ✅ Implement smooth progressive loading experience
- ✅ Maintain visual quality across all devices
- ✅ Support modern image formats with fallbacks
- ✅ Professional loading states and error handling

### Technical Requirements

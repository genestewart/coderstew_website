# CoderStew Website Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

**Project Goal:** Build a professional freelance web development studio website for CoderStew that converts visitors into clients through strategic positioning and streamlined booking flow.

**Success Metrics:**
- Primary: 30-minute discovery call bookings via Microsoft Bookings integration
- Secondary: Newsletter signups, portfolio engagement, contact form submissions
- Technical: Self-hosted deployment on Unraid with Docker, maintainable codebase

**Value Proposition:** 
- Showcase CoderStew's technical expertise through a modern, performant website
- Demonstrate full-stack capabilities with Laravel 11 + Vue 3 + PrimeVue 3 stack
- Provide seamless client onboarding experience from first visit to booked consultation
- Enable content management through Backpack CMS for ongoing marketing efforts

## Key Challenges and Analysis

**Technical Challenges:**
1. **Microsoft Bookings Integration:** Limited API documentation, need to handle authentication and booking widget embedding
2. **Self-hosted Infrastructure:** Docker containerization, SSL certificates, backup strategies, monitoring
3. **Performance Optimization:** Image optimization for portfolio, efficient Vue 3 hydration, API response caching
4. **SEO & Marketing:** Server-side rendering considerations, meta tag management, blog content indexing

**Architectural Decisions:**
- **API-First Design:** Laravel backend serves Vue frontend + future mobile apps
- **Component-Based UI:** PrimeVue 3 for consistent design system and rapid development
- **Headless CMS Approach:** Backpack for content management, API endpoints for frontend consumption
- **Containerized Deployment:** Docker Compose for easy deployment and scaling on Unraid

**Risk Mitigation:**
- **Data Loss:** Automated database backups, version control for code
- **Downtime:** Health checks, graceful error handling, fallback contact methods
- **Security:** Input validation, CSRF protection, rate limiting, secure headers
- **Scalability:** Efficient database queries, image optimization, CDN considerations

## Lessons

**From PRD Review Process:**
- Keep the booking flow as simple as possible - single call-to-action for discovery calls
- Portfolio should be the hero feature - showcase technical capabilities prominently
- Self-hosted infrastructure requires careful planning for backup and monitoring
- PrimeVue 3 will accelerate development but requires component customization
- Microsoft Bookings integration is critical but may need fallback options

**Development Principles:**
- Start with MVP features and iterate based on user feedback
- Prioritize performance and SEO from the beginning
- Write tests for business-critical functionality
- Document decisions and architecture for future maintenance
- Plan for content updates and ongoing marketing needs

**Technical Considerations:**
- Laravel 11 API design should be RESTful and well-documented
- Vue 3 components should be reusable and properly typed
- Database schema must support future feature additions
- Docker configuration should be production-ready from day one
- Security measures must be implemented at every layer

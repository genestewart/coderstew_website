# CoderStew Website Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

**Project Goal:** Build a professional freelance web development studio website for CoderStew that converts visitors into clients through strategic positioning and streamlined booking flow.

**Success Metrics:**
- Primary: 30-minute discovery call bookings via Microsoft Bookings integration
- Secondary: Newsletter signups, portfolio engagement, contact form submissions
- Technical: Self-hosted deployment on Unraid with Docker, maintainable codebase

**Value Proposition:** 
- Showcase CoderStew's technical expertise through a modern, performant website
- Demonstrate full-stack capabilities with Laravel 11 + Vue 3 + PrimeVue 3 stack
- Provide seamless client onboarding experience from first visit to booked consultation
- Enable content management through Backpack CMS for ongoing marketing efforts

## Key Challenges and Analysis

**Technical Challenges:**
1. **Microsoft Bookings Integration:** Limited API documentation, need to handle authentication and booking widget embedding
2. **Self-hosted Infrastructure:** Docker containerization, SSL certificates, backup strategies, monitoring
3. **Performance Optimization:** Image optimization for portfolio, efficient Vue 3 hydration, API response caching
4. **SEO & Marketing:** Server-side rendering considerations, meta tag management, blog content indexing

**Architectural Decisions:**
- **API-First Design:** Laravel backend serves Vue frontend + future mobile apps
- **Component-Based UI:** PrimeVue 3 for consistent design system and rapid development
- **Headless CMS Approach:** Backpack for content management, API endpoints for frontend consumption
- **Containerized Deployment:** Docker Compose for easy deployment and scaling on Unraid

## Current Sprint Focus

**Immediate Priorities (Next 1-2 weeks):**
- [OUTDATED - Completed] Review and approve tasks 6-10 currently under review
- Begin Task 11: API service layer implementation

**Current Blockers:** None

**Risk Items:**
- Microsoft Bookings API integration complexity (Task 31)
- Production deployment complexity on Unraid (Tasks 12-15)

## Dependency Map

**Critical Path Tasks:**
- Tasks 1 → 2 → 3 (Backend foundation) ✅
- Tasks 1 → 4 → 5 (Frontend foundation) ✅  
- Tasks 6 → 7 → 11 (API layer) 🔍
- Tasks 10 → 12 → 13 → 15 (Infrastructure) 🔍

**Ready to Start (no dependencies pending):**
- Task 31: Microsoft Bookings API research
- Task 16: Portfolio models (depends on completed Task 2)

## Lessons Learned

**Development Principles:**
- Start with MVP features and iterate based on user feedback
- Prioritize performance and SEO from the beginning
- Write tests for business-critical functionality
- Document decisions and architecture for future maintenance
- Plan for content updates and ongoing marketing needs

**Technical Considerations:**
- Laravel 11 API design should be RESTful and well-documented
- Vue 3 components should be reusable and properly typed
- Database schema must support future feature additions
- Docker configuration should be production-ready from day one
- Security measures must be implemented at every layer
